About RobotPy
===============

`RobotPy`_ is a distribution of `Python`_ intended to be used for the `FIRST
Robotics Competition`_.  Teams can use this to write their robot code in
Python, a powerful dynamic programming language.

Features
==========

*  `Python`_ is simple to learn and easy to maintain.
*  RobotPy lets you reload code without restarting.
*  RobotPy provides access to the WPILib class library.
*  You don't need to use WindRiver (unless you're rebuilding RobotPy itself).

Installation from Source
==========================

To build the interpreter and loadable modules: Run Start|Programs|Wind River|
VxWorks 6.3 and General Purpose Technologies|VxWorks Development Shell.
CD to the directory where you cloned the git repository.  Run "make dist".

Connect to your robot's IP with an FTP client (e.g. ``ftp://10.XX.YY.2/``,
where XXYY is your team number).  Copy the ``dist\RobotPy-Core\robot`` and
``dist\RobotPy-WPILib\robot`` directory trees to the root (top level)
directory on the robot.  Alternatively, install.py can be run in each of
these directories to do this for you.

Technical Overview
====================

RobotPy is a packaging of a patched `Python`_ 3.1.2 interpreter (found in the
``RobotPy/Python`` subdirectory of the source code).  All access to the WPILib
is generated by a `SIP`_ interface, which is found in ``Packages/wpilib/sip/``.
When the robot is started, it initializes the Python interpreter and runs the
file ``py/boot.py``.  From there, all responsibility is given to the
``boot.py`` script, which is referred to as the bootloader.

If ``boot.py`` ever exits (due to an exception, for example), the C++ code
exits.  The default ``boot.py`` simply exits on any user exception.  If this
happens, you can reboot easily via NetConsole by simply typing "reboot"
followed by hitting the enter key.  This is how code reloads are performed.
As boot.py is written in Python, this behavior can be customized as desired.

Major Differences from standard Python
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*  Several Python modules with large and/or incompatible dependencies removed,
   namely: curses, dbm, gdbm, tkinter, nis, ossaudiodev, resource, spwd,
   syslog, termios, audioop, bz2, crypt, grp, ssl, pwd, and mmap.
